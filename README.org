* ABOUT  - <2020-07-26 Sun 11:30> - Converting org files to markdown, which looks better. Has the weird little index, etc, but still looks better. M-x C-c C-e runs the command org-export-dispatch, here are the markdown export commands from info:
Markdown export commands
------------------------
‘C-c C-e m m     (org-md-export-to-markdown)’
     Export to a text file with Markdown syntax.  For ‘myfile.org’, Org
     exports to ‘myfile.md’, overwritten without warning.
‘C-c C-e m M     (org-md-export-as-markdown)’
