# Pranayama Readme
**I have been doing breath work (*pranayama*), doing very deep breathing consisting of 4 distinct segments:  
1. packing the prana in, for the intial period,   
2. holding on a complete exhale for the second period,   
3. breathing in for the third period,   
4. and holding after a complete inhale.   **

I'm using the (stopwatch code created by ASNR) [https://github.com/asnr/stopwatch] .
