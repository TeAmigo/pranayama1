Sample run:

* Initial  - <2020-07-26 Sun 15:36> - -<7.2>- by hitting 'e' in the stopwatch window, jump up here and make a note, record when the note is made. -<1:32.7>- 
*** EmptyHold  - <2020-07-26 Sun 16:12> - -<17.1>- 17.1 seconds into the EmptyHold, hit 'e' in stopwatch window to come up here, and make this note. I'll use C-z to go back to the stopwatch window, and then 'l' there to start the next segment. -<1:54.9>- 
***** InBreath  - <2020-07-26 Sun 16:38> -  -<44.9>- 
******* FullHold  - <2020-07-26 Sun 16:42> - Didn't pop up to tame any notes on the InBreath, so only the total time appears for it (44.9 above). Took this note without going back to stopwatch window.-<1:26.0>- 
********* And this is where it ends. Need to jump back to stopwatch and shut it down with 'q'.
